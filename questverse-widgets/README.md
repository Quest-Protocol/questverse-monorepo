## Getting Started 

```
npm install
```

Then, run the command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will serve the widgets from `http://127.0.0.1:4040/`.

Go to [everything.dev/flags](https://everything.dev) and paste this value there.

Once set, see the locally served app at [bos.questverse.near/widget/app](https://everything.dev/bos.questverse.near/widget/app).
